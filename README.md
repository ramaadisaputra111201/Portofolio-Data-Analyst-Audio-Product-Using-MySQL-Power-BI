# Portofolio-Data-Analyst-Audio-Product-Using-MySQL-Power-BI

In this project, I performed data cleaning and product sales analysis using SQL. The dataset consisted of 1,045 combined product stock records from a retail store. The initial stage focused on cleaning the data by removing the dollar symbol (“$”) from the Cost Price and Sale Price columns so that the values could be converted into numeric formats suitable for analytical calculations. Next, data from the product_data, product_sales, and discount_data tables were combined using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to create an integrated dataset containing product, pricing, sales, and monthly discount information. From this transformation, I calculated key metrics such as revenue, total cost, and discount revenue to analyze the impact of discounts on sales performance. The results were then visualized using Power BI to display sales trends and the effectiveness of discount strategies interactively.
